  GNU gdb port to mingw32
  Version: 5.2.1
  

1) Please check the doc/gdb/PORTPATCH for what has entailed.  I'm not the
culprit for the patch.
2) I replaced the readline library which was version 4.1 with the mingw
modified 4.2 version.  I also applied the patch as given in the October 10th,
2002 release candidate.
3) AFAIK, this is essentially the same release as the Release Candidate dated
October 10th, 2002.
4) I plan to release an Insight GDB version, eventually.
5) I plan to create a 5.3 release candidate, soon.
*) Report bugs to mingw-users@lists.sf.net first for this port release.
*) These changes have yet to be submitted for review.
